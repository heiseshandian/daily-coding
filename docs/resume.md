## Project Experience

**Cool Ringtones H5 Front-End Refactoring**  
*July 2019 - December 2019*  

- **Background:** The outdated front-end framework, with a tech stack 6-7 years old, hindered the team's efficiency, leading to frequent overtime and code disorganization. The front-end refactoring project aimed to revamp the entire structure to meet the demands of rapid business development.
- **Technologies:** Lerna, Vue, TypeScript, Webpack, Node.js
- **Challenges:** Complex logic scattered across various versions, with new technologies like Lerna and TypeScript being relatively unfamiliar.
- **Achievements:** Implemented a chain of responsibility pattern to optimize the core subscription logic, making it more maintainable and configurable. Developed custom Webpack and PostCSS plugins to enhance code reuse and image optimization. The refactor significantly boosted development efficiency and simplified maintenance.

**Cool Ringtones H5 Automation Testing Framework**  
*December 2019 - April 2020*  

- **Background:** Due to the complexity of the subscription logic influenced by various operators and user statuses, the testing workload was extensive. The goal was to automate the regression testing process to reduce the burden on testers.
- **Technologies:** Lerna, TypeScript, Jest, Puppeteer
- **Challenges:** The subscription paths were unpredictable, requiring a flexible and configurable testing framework.
- **Achievements:** Developed a framework that abstracted subscription paths into minimal process units, significantly reducing regression testing time from 1-2 days to just half a day.

**BCA Module Refactoring**  
*May 2021 - November 2022*  

- **Background:** The BCA module, designed to customize key configurations on various phone models, struggled to adapt to the increasing variety of devices, necessitating frequent changes across multiple teams.
