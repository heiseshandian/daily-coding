https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-number-of-marked-indices/description/

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.

Initially, all of the indices are unmarked. You are allowed to make this operation any number of times:

Pick two different unmarked indices i and j such that 2 * nums[i] <= nums[j], then mark i and j.
Return the maximum possible number of marked indices in nums using the above operation any number of times.

先从小到大排序，然后用两个指针，左边从0开始，右边从中点开始（必须从中点，确保稍微大的数可以和尽可能小的数组合）

You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed).

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to the closest person.
